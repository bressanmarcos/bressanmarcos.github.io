# List of Certificates

Hello, visitor!

Below you will find a non-exhaustive list of some of my certifications. Of course, these certificates do not define the degree of knowledge or experience I have with each of the tools, but it shows a bit of my commitment to keeping myself updated and active, always trying to learn new things every day!
Soon I intend to categorize them and describe a little of what I was able to learn in each minute of learning.
