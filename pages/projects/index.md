### Machine Learning
- [Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/PlagiarismDetector/) - Use of Machine Learning to classify texts as several levels of plagiarism. The project uses the K-nearest neighbors algorithm and is written to be executed in an AWS Sagemaker notebook.
- [Population Clusterization](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/PopulationClusterization/) - Use of Machine Learning in AWS Sagemaker to segment american counties into distinct groups based on data from US Census. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means are some of the unsupervised machine learning concepts applied in this project.
