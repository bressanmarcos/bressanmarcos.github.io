### Counding Candles

This is a small program that I wrote for a project at Freelancer.com.
It was made to configure alarms that warn when a certain currency pair reaches a certain sequence of candles of the same color (all BULL or BEAR).
A special feature is the ability to advance the alarm for a few seconds when the last candle is about to close in the same color that would complete the desired sequence. The anticipation time is also configurable.

It has been adapted to read information obtained by connecting to Web Sockets from IQOption.

It was written in Python and was tested on Windows and Linux. It was originally written in Spanish.
