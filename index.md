# Marcos **Bressan**

I am a Software Engineer and DevOps specialist with a passion for solving complex problems through scalable, reliable technology. With over five years of experience in Python development, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack solutions, I’ve built systems that optimize performance, reduce costs, and support the growth of businesses. From cloud-native architectures to automated CI/CD pipelines, I focus on creating solutions that are both efficient and secure.

I hold a double degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Ceará ([UFC](http://www.ufc.br)) in Brazil and the École [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr) in France. My diverse academic background and international experience in France have shaped my expertise in data systems, cloud computing, and software engineering. Throughout my career, I’ve led projects that modernized legacy systems, enhanced performance using Kubernetes and AWS, and implemented robust data validation tools like Deirokay.

Whether I’m working on big data projects, optimizing cloud environments, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I am driven by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact.
