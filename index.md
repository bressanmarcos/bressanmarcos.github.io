# Marcos **Bressan**

Born in Piquete, in the countryside of São Paulo, and raised in Fortaleza, Brazil, since my high school I have always been interested in Physics and Electrical phenomena. Although highly passionate by Pure Maths, Statistics and logical formalism, I naturally went for Electrical Engineering studies when faced by the decision, inspired by the potential technological development of the domain and the challenges inherent in the profession of engineer.

In 2020, I officially graduated in Electrical Engineering, obtaining a diploma valid in both Brazilian and French territories, thanks to a double degree program brought forth by a partnership between the Federal University of Ceará ([UFC](http://www.ufc.br)) and the École [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr).

In France, where I experienced two internships in different companies, my professional project was mainly guided through the fields of Telecommunication Systems, Computer Networks and Power Systems, reasons why I became especially attracted to Machine Learning, Smart Grids, Internet of Things and System Engineering.

This website is still under development, but you can also check out my profiles on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/bressanmarcos) and [Github](https://github.com/bressanmarcos)!

## Projects

Below you will find some of my projects ordered by theme/category.
Please, be aware that this page is still in development and many projects are not listed here. You can find more of them on my [Github](https://github.com/bressanmarcos).

### Smart Grids, Distributed Computing, Multi-Agent Systems
- [PADE - Python Agent DEvelopment framework](https://github.com/grei-ufc/pade) (Contributor) - A FIPA-compliant platform for creation, execution and management of agents for Multi-Agent Systems. (My personal fork with some pending features to be PR'ed is available [here](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/pade))
- [Multi-agent Automatic Restoration System (MARS)](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/smad-cim) - A Multi-Agent System (MAS) built with [PADE](https://github.com/grei-ufc/pade) for distribution systems automation within Smart Grids environments. Link for article: (soon!)
- [cimrdf.py](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/cimrdf.py) - An open source tool to handle CIM RDF (IEC 61970-501) documents in Python.

### Machine Learning
- [Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/PlagiarismDetector/) - Use of Machine Learning to classify texts as several levels of plagiarism. The project uses the K-nearest neighbors algorithm and is written to be executed in an AWS Sagemaker notebook.
- [Population Clusterization](https://github.com/bressanmarcos/PopulationClusterization/) - Use of Machine Learning in AWS Sagemaker to segment american counties into distinct groups based on data from US Census. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means are some of the unsupervised machine learning concepts applied in this project.

### Freelance (private source code)
- [System for managing event registrants](pages/st) - Web-based system for managing enrollments in private events.
- [CountingCandles](pages/countingcandles) - A software to count candles sequence of same color for IQOption and to detect trends.
